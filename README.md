📚 12-Week Real + Complex AI Implementation Challenge

A comprehensive Machine Learning + Deep Learning + Complex-Valued AI repository covering 100+ models, from classical ML to diffusion models.

Each implementation includes:

✔ Real-valued model

✔ Complex-valued version

✔ Dataset-specific training scripts

✔ Performance comparison + notes

This repo is designed as a complete 12-week curriculum for mastering AI across both real and complex domains.

🌟 Repository Goals

This repository aims to:

Build a unified codebase covering classical ML → modern DL → advanced AI systems

Provide real and complex versions of every model

Create a benchmark suite comparing real-valued vs complex-valued architectures

Serve as a reference for MRI reconstruction, signal processing, communications, spectrograms, and more

Help learners and researchers gain practical mastery through hands-on implementation
